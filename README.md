# babys-first-malware

These are my old programs in the weird applescript scripting language that I found on my computer from when I was in middle school. I was really into the idea of making silly pieces of 'malware' that I'd send to my friends during class as pranks. (As you can see I didn't know about version control yet, so every time I made an update, I'd just save the file with a new name for some reason.)

## Goofy Payloads
- TMF ('Too Many Files') -> February 2017
    - Repeatedly just makes a lot of files, eventually crashing your computer.
- HBS ('Happy Birthday Script') -> February 2017
    - Makes an alert telling the user its their birthday and asking if they'd like to hear a song. Either way it'll sing a song at max volume with their real name.
- Kaboom! -> November 2017
    - Quits finder and then deletes itself (but quitting finder looked pretty scary to me back in the day).
- Lit Title Generator -> November 2017
    - In 2017 clickbait youtube videos were really popular so I thought it would be funny to make a program that could randomly generate clickbait titles for things.
- Typo -> December 2017
    - Just types some random text every once in a while.
- Keyboard Cat -> April 2019
    - Opens a lot of tabs to the [keyboard cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J---aiyznGQ) youtube video and continually redirects any tabs you open to the video. It also locks your volume at maximum with a taunting message if you try to change it.
    - Unfortunately I sold out and changed the video to never gonna give you up in the second version :(

## Semi-useful Programs
- Spy Game -> January 2018
    - I was really into spy movies at hidden role games (like werewolf and mafia) at the time, so I was thinking it'd be really cool to have spy-themed nerf gun fights with my friends. But if I was the one assigning roles and situations, I couldn't play because I'd know all the roles and there'd be no mystery.
    - So I made this script to automatically generate a randomized secret scenario (like one player rescuing another and taking them to a safe-house) and then only tell each player what they needed to know (eg. what weapons they got, where they started in the house and what costume they got to wear) so that we would all have to figure things out during the game.
    - From what I remember it worked pretty well! But I think I got initially too excited and concocted up scenarios that actually made for pretty boring nerf fights :(
- Typing.com Hack -> April 2018
    - Back in school, we used to have to do this typing.com website to practice typing and my teacher offered a chocolate bar to whomever could beat her at typing. But at the time the site had a very finite number of texts to test you on. This program just waits a little while and then types out the whole text at a pre-specified wpm.
    - In order to make this strategy work even when the teacher was watching my screen, the program sends stupidly coded notifications over time and you turn your volume all the way up to signal which one corresponds to the text you got (that way I could start running the program earlier and my screen wouldn't look suspicious when she was watching).
