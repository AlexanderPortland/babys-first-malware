Those colorful designs tell potential predators, \"I'mm toxic; don't eat me\". Scientists think that poison dart frogs get their toxicity from some of the insects they eat. The insects feed on plants that have toxins, which then pass into the frogs when they eat the insects. Poison dart frogs raised in captivity aren'tt toxic because the insects they are fed haven'tt eaten poisonous plants. How do poison dart frogs capture their prey? With a long, sticky tongue that farts out and zaps the unsuspecting bug! The frogs eat many kinds of small insects, including fruit flies, ants, and tiny beetles, which are the ones scientists think may be responsible for the frogs'  toxicity. Poison dart frogs live in the rain forests of central and south America and breed during the rainy season. To attract a female, the male frog calls from a leaf, making buzzing or trilling sounds. After he'ss attracted a mate and she lays her eggs, the male sticks around to make sure the eggs stay moist until they hatch. Once the little ones hatch, as tiny tadpoles, they wiggle on to the male's back. He carries them to a pool of water, where the tadpoles wiggle off and complete their metamorphosis into fully formed frogs."

Fitness not only encourages physical activity, keeping weight and accompanying conditions at bay, it also helps protect children from injuries that can occur when they are not accustomed to physical activity, movement and sports. Most injuries that plague children completing physical activities occur as a result of a lifestyle that lacks movement and activity that can provide balance, coordination and muscle memory necessary for a fit lifestyle. Despite statistics praising physical activity amongst children as a weight management tool and method of decreasing injuries during activities and sports, fitness among children boasts a plethora of positive results and side effects. Strong bones and joints, stress relief, self confidence improvement and better academic concentration are just some of the other benefits touted by a child'ss active lifestyle. Understanding what types of activities and scheduling conflicts are preventing a child from obtaining a sufficient amount of physical activity and fitness can be a good way for parents to begin to understand how and where transformations can be made regarding kids'  health. Tracking the amount of activity a child partakes can be as simple as gaining an awareness of their school schedules and whether they include physical education classes, recess and other ways children participate in fitness centered activities. Children who participate in a variety of physically demanding activities at school, such as extracurricular athletics or PE classes, may not need as much prompting and extra fitness added to their day as a child who spends more time still and sedentary. One of the best ways parents, caregivers and teachers can prompt children to compete in fitness activities and grasp a healthy lifestyle is by striving toward adopting a similar lifestyle that promotes and values physical activity. Childrens with even one obese parent have a 50 percent chance of being obese themselves. Childrens with two obese parents have an 80 percent chance of following in their footsteps. Childrens who observe healthy lifestyles in their parents and role models have a better chance of adopting similar habits, highlighting the vital role parents play in influencing the fitness levels and physical activity of children."
